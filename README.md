Yify-Script-Scraper
===================

this script will pull the 1080p and 720p movies from yify-torrents.com. It will compare the 720p movies to the 1080p movies and download the uniques.


Download the package and put the _XMLDomWrapper.au3 in the includes folder of Autoit. Then just run the script

This requires that AutoIT is installed. You can get that from http://www.autoitscript.com/site/




TODO

1) Add a Gui
2) Add a DB so that it remembers what it has already retrieved
3) Add ability to dump to folder where your torrent watch folder is located
4) Anything else I can think of
